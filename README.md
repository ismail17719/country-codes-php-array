# country-codes-php-array
This project is composed of a single file containing a PHP array of dial codes, country codes and country names for all the countries of the world. I was working on a project and I needed an associative array in which the key is the dial code of a country, followed by a value that is another associative array of country's name and its two letter shortcode. I had to build it in this format from scratch and I don't want anyone else to go through that pain again.

I might have overlooked some small autonomous regions which do have their own codes. You are welcome to add if you find any such. Thanks and happy coding. ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚
